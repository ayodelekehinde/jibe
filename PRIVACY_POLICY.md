# Privacy Policy for Jibe

**Last updated: December 22, 2025**

**Cherrio LLC** ("we", "our", or "us") operates the **Jibe** application (the "Service"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Unlike many other applications, **Jibe does not collect, store, or share your personal data.**

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**We do not collect any personal data.**

Jibe is a peer-to-peer (P2P) local network application designed to work offline or within your local Intranet.
-   **No Account Required**: You do not need to create an account to use Jibe.
-   **No External Servers**: All data transferred (clipboard content, text, files) is transmitted directly between your devices over your local network (LAN) via encrypted or raw TCP sockets.
-   **No Analytics**: We do not use third-party analytics or tracking software (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase).

## 2. Permissions and Data Access

To provide its core functionality, Jibe requests specific permissions on your device. These are used **strictly** for local functionality:

### Android & Mobile
-   **Local Network Access**: Required to discover other devices on your WiFi network.
-   **Notifications**: Used to alert you when a file or clipboard item is received.
-   **Storage / File Access**: Required only when you explicitly choose to save a received file to your Downloads folder.

### Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux)
-   **Network Access**: To open a local port for receiving connections.
-   **File System**: to save files you choose to download.
-   **System Tray**: To run in the background and listen for connections.

## 3. Data Transfer and Security

All transfers occur strictly between your devices.
-   Data never leaves your local network.
-   We do not have access to your transferred data.
-   While we prioritize local security, we recommend using Jibe on trusted networks (e.g., Home or Office WiFi) rather than public WiFi, as local traffic can potentially be intercepted by others on the same open network.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. Since we do not collect personal information, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
